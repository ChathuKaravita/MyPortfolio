Place your CV PDF in the project root with the filename `Chathurya_Karavita_CV.pdf`.

- To enable the download button on the homepage, save your CV at the project root (same folder as `index.html`) with the exact name above.
- If you prefer a different filename or location, update the href on the download link in `index.html`:

  <a class="cta" href="YOUR_PATH_OR_FILENAME.pdf" download>Download CV</a>

That's it â€” when `index.html` is served, clicking "Download CV" will download the PDF file.
